			<h3>Hi, it's been a month since you said yes. It is not actually the "YES" word, but you made this day a very special day to remember.</h3>
			<h3> I didn't expect us to share the same vibes, energy, and academic goals.  I didn't expect to fall harder or to fall in love with you more with each passing day. I will not promise anything.  </h3>
			<h3>I’ll just do my best to show you everything you need to see and to make you feel everything you need to feel because you deserve it.  You deserve everything in this world, love. </h3>
			<h3> I know we’re kilometers apart, but my love for you remains as it is. Even though distance is one of the hindrances to making you feel loved, I will still find a way to make you feel the love you deserve.</h3>
			<h3>I will not say anything anymore; just wait and feel those things that you need to feel as your lover. I love you so much, love. more months to come!  </h3>
